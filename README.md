# Hydrosmart
A Water Conservation App designed for use in workplaces, colleges, and various other environments.


The HydroSmart project introduces an intelligent water conservation system designed for sustainable campuses and workspaces. It targets the inefficiencies and wastage associated with conventional water cooler management systems by implementing advanced sensor technology, automated shut-off mechanisms, and user-friendly interfaces. Through rigorous testing, data collection, and educational outreach, HydroSmart aims to significantly reduce water wastage, promote responsible water usage, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
